# Car Sales Dashboard Project Using Power BI

## Introduction

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze car sales data, track performance metrics, and provide valuable insights to improve sales strategies. The dashboard helps car dealerships optimize their operations and make data-driven decisions.

## Data Overview

The project utilizes datasets containing car sales data, including variables such as sale amounts, sales dates, car models, body styles, colors, and dealer regions. These datasets are crucial for understanding and optimizing sales performance.

## Research Objective

The objective of this project is to:
1. Clean and preprocess the car sales datasets.
2. Develop an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends.
4. Provide actionable insights based on the dashboard analysis.

## Data Cleaning

The car sales datasets were cleaned by:
- Removing rows with missing values.
- Eliminating duplicate entries.
- Converting date columns to datetime format for accurate analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
